# Shawty

Shawty is a URL shortener with a modern, sleek dashboard that lets users track all the links they’ve created. 

In addition to advanced analytics (WIP), it enables users to generate a short URL from any valid link. It’s built with scalability in mind as a System Design challenge.

# Installation

Change directory to the `server` folder and run the following code to start the backend server

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Run the same code in the `client` folder to start the next js server

The website will be live at `localhost:3000`
